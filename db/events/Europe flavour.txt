On March 1st 1934, Dutch astronomer Gerrit Kuiper announced that he and his assistants had discovered the elusive and distant planet by carefully comparing pictures taken on different dates. The discovery came as a disappointment to many other astronomers, who had dreamed of finding it themselves first. The planet received the name 'Pluto' after the Roman god of the underworld."
